Roomle offers two primary methods for integrating our tools into your applications: Rubens Products (as iframe embedded) and SDK (Software Development Kit). While both approaches aim to provide seamless integration of Roomle functionalities, they differ in their implementation and use cases. Understanding the distinctions between these methods is crucial for determining the most suitable approach for your specific requirements. Both are managed in the Rubens Admin platform where the content is created in Roomle Script.

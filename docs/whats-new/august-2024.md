## Room designer news

### Go live of Vector draw mode

We set the new drawing mode ("vector draw mode") live as the default drawing mode. It allows us to use the precise measurements from drawing after a room is created. This improves the drawing mode as the wall's thickness is added after creating the room outline without changing the wall's measurements. It works like this; a room vector is drawn which reflects the inner wall measurement of the room. After the room is closed or the drawing is finished (like for a single wall) a wall is entered with exactly the length the the user had drawn.

## Rubens Admin news

### Level 1 improvements - Individual external identifiers

As a level 1 user, you can now also create individual external identifiers the same way as the higher level users already can. In the product form of your new product inside Rubens Admin you find the field external identifier, which is used to identify your product (for example for embedding your 3D viewer in your webshop). To prevent entering invalid IDs, we also implemented a validation for the external identifier, which gives you a hint, if you used invalid characters.

### Snap logic for z-level

The new snap logic for z-level allows users to predefine horizontal lines along walls, enabling furniture to snap precisely in the z direction as it is moved. This enhancement streamlines alignment and positioning, ensuring that items are placed accurately according to the defined guidelines.

We have taken the initial steps towards integrating roof tops into the Room Designer. These developments are currently present in our logic core, enabling foundational support for roof top design. While these features are not yet available in the user interface, we are actively working on completing this integration and expect them to be accessible soon.

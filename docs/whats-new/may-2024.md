### Keyboard input for drawing

When drawing walls, we can now enter values while drawing directly from the keyboard as soon as the measurement bubble of the drawn wall is visible. This feature is only available on Desktop.

### Drawing raster - Rounded values while drawing

We now use an invisible 1cm raster while drawing in room designer 2D mode which results in rounded values while drawing. Users can still enter precise decimal values via the controls in the menu of the Room Designer.

### 2D arches for configurable doors

Configurable doors also now have opening direction arches displayed in 2D.

### No overlapping arrows in Room Designer

In the past, you could have had overlapping measurement arrows in the corners of the room at certain zoom levels. We now prevent overlapping arrows in 2D mode by always displaying the same distance between the wall and the measurement line.

### Info messages in first-person mode of the Room Designer

We now show info messages about how to navigate through the room after the opening of the first-person mode. This is especially relevant on mobile where we do not have a keyboard to navigate through the room.

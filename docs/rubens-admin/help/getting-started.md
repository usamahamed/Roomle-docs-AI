# Getting started

## 3D Viewer

* Sign in and start by [creating your first static product](products.md#create-a-static-product). You can upload your own 3D model. Once the model is uploaded you see the preview of the product. You can orbit around or zoom in and out. Scroll down to the statistics of the uploaded model. The result indicates if the content meets the technical requirements for Rubens.
* If you are happy with the result you can save the new product to your account.
* The product will be `processed` to render thumbnails. The assets will be prepared for Rubens Admin. The processing time may vary depending on the complexity of your product and the current number of requests. You will receive an e-mail as soon as the product is finished.
* Once processing finished for your product, you can [embed it into your website](products.md#embed-a-product).

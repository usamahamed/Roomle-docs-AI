# Sample products and files

## Basic product

If you do not have 3D data files at hand, you can use our already created sample products. Display or hide the sample products at the top of the overview by opening the menu in the right upper corner and select the `Show sample products` or `Hide sample products` entry.

Or use our sample files to [create a product](../help/products.md#create-or-archive-a-product) by yourself:

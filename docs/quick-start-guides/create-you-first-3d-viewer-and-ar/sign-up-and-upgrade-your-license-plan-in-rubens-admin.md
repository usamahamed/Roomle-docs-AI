## Free 14-day trial period

As you can see on top of the grid view, you are granted a free 14-day trial to test the creation of items in Rubens Admin and to view them with the Rubens 3D Viewer. If you want to know how products are created, you can check out [this page](create-a-product-for-the-rubens-3d-viewer.md). Keep in mind, in the free 14-day trial you are only allowed to create a limited amount of products. So if you want to create more products, you need to upgrade your license plan to at least Level 1.



## Upgrade your license plan

Once your 14-day trial ends, you can upgrade your license plan either via clicking the "Upgrade here" link in the message on top or via the Pricing & billing option in the burger menu on the left top. There you can see all the other options for the upgrade available. If you want to know more about the license plans and their corresponding pricing, you can find it [here](https://www.roomle.com/en/pricing).&#x20;

After selecting a license plan for upgrading, you are required to enter your billing information. Once the billing information is saved, you can go one step further to Stripe which we use for the payment process. There you need to enter your payment data and the license plan you want to upgrade to. You can select if you want to pay on a monthly or yearly basis.&#x20;

Once you approved a license plan and entered your payment data accordingly, you will see in the overview your current license plan, when the next payment is due along with other information like your billing information and invoice history. You can change all of the aspects directly in there, in case you want for example to quit or upgrade your license plan or you want to update your payment data. Once your license upgrade is done, you can navigate back to Rubens Admin and continue to create products there. If you still see the message about your license plan ending soon, we recommend logging out and logging in again.

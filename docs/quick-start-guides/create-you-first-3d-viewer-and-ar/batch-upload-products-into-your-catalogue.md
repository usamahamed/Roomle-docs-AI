# Batch upload products into your catalogue

If you want to use the Rubens 3D Viewer to integrate your 3D objects into your webshop, you need to upload your 3D models into the Rubens Admin platform.&#x20;

Once you have [signed up in Rubens Admin](sign-up-and-upgrade-your-license-plan-in-rubens-admin.md), you can upload products into your catalogue to start using them according to your needs. You can either [upload single items](create-a-product-for-the-rubens-3d-viewer.md) or batches into your catalogue.

To do so, you can navigate to the products section of your catalogue. On top of the products list, you will find a form to import your products. Make sure your 3D models are inside a zip container before you drop them into the import form.&#x20;

Before uploading, ensure that your data meets the platform's format requirements. This will prevent long wait times for data that does not conform to the necessary standards. Utilize our free [Content Analyzer](https://admin.roomle.com/content-analyzer) tool at Content Analyzer to verify your products. If your data is compliant, proceed with the upload.
{% endhint %}

After approving the action, the import process is triggered. Note that this process can take up to a few hours as a huge amount of data is processed. You can safely navigate away from the page in the meantime as you will get an email that informs you about your import being finished and your data is ready to be used.

### Draft catalogue creation

For each batch you upload, a draft catalogue is created so that you can check your 3D data before it lands in your live catalogue. After checking the 3D data within the draft catalogue, you can easily merge the draft catalogue into your live catalogue with a few clicks. If you want to know more about draft catalogues and how they are merged, you can [visit the following page](https://docs.roomle.com/rubens/rubens-admin/help/catalogs#draft-catalogs).



Once you merged your draft catalogue into your live catalogue you can check out your items within the Rubens 3D viewer and embed it into your webshop.&#x20;

# Listen to events

As Rubens is fully api based we also give all our events like \`item selected\` to the outside of the iframe. We call it \`callback\` which are basically empty functions which are getting called by the configurator but have then a behaviour which is defined in the java script outside.

In this section you will find different guides how you can fetch different data and events in the configurator.

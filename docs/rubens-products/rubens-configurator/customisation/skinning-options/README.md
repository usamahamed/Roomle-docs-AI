# Skinning options

Rubens offers two powerful skinning options to help you tailor the interface to match your brand identity or design preferences. First, you can customize the font used throughout the interface, ensuring consistency with your overall branding.

Additionally, Rubens allows you to adjust various color elements, such as the color of the call-to-action (CTA) buttons, highlight colors used for emphasis, and even the background color of the 3D scene. These options provide you with the flexibility to create a visually appealing and cohesive user experience that aligns perfectly with your brandâ€™s aesthetic. Whether you're looking for subtle changes or a complete transformation, Rubens' skinning options give you the control to make the interface truly your own.

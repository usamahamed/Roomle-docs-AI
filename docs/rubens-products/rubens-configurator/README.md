# Rubens Configurator

The Rubens Configurator is our ready to use configurator solution where we packed an intuitive user interface on the top of our powerful 3D scene. It is widely adaptable and skinable which makes it perfect for a needless integration of your webshop or website environment. It is embedded as an iframe which makes it 100% maintainence free with automatic updates.

So if we step one step back and want to have a wider view on our embedding landscape we see on the one hand, there is your webshop and on the other hand, there is the Roomle Configurator. The configurator runs client-side which means there is no need for any server-side language like PHP etc. Everything just happens in plain old JavaScript.

To ease the communication between your website and the Roomle Configurator we provide a small JavaScript library that can be used to call methods of the configurator or to subscribe to events.

Those methods and events give you the ability to flexibly integrate the configurator as you need it.

This tutorial will guide you through some uses cases and should give you the knowledge to implement whatever you need.

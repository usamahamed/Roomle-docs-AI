The Rubens Configurator uses Google Analytics. You can find out how you can react to analytics events on your side in our [listen to analytic events documentation.](../listen-to-events/analytic-events.md)

Please find here an overview of the most relevant tracking events that might be of interest for analysing your configurator usage.

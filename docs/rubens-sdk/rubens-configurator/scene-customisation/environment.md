# Environment

The environment defines how the background of the furniture looks like. By default the GLTF background is loaded, which is a slightly grey object. Currently there are 4 different background types to choose from:

* Floor
* Image
* Color
* GLTF

You can find all the details in our reference: [EnvironmentSetting](../../rubens-sdk-reference/interfaces/common\_core\_src\_environment\_dynamic\_environment\_setting\_loader.EnvironmentSetting.md).

# Rubens Planner (Room Designer)

As the configurator it is also possible to use our Room Designer as a SDK, but we strongly recommend to use our embedding solution. For the Room Designer we built a lot user interface elements which has to build by your own if you want to use our SDK.&#x20;

However, if you want to find all methods you can use - have a look in the Rubens Room Designer Reference: [planner\_core\_src\_roomle\_planner.default.md](../rubens-sdk-reference/classes/planner\_core\_src\_roomle\_planner.default.md "mention").

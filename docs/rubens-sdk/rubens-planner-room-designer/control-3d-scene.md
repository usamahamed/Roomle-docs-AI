# Control 3D Scene

Rubens SDK is a powerful, fully API-based 3D rendering engine designed to provide users with complete control over their 3D scene. You can switch light settings, can control the camera and switch parameters. All this with simple function calls.&#x20;

**For example:**

```typescript
RoomlePlanner.enableMultiselect();
```

You can look up all available functions in this reference: [planner\_core\_src\_roomle\_planner.default.md](../rubens-sdk-reference/classes/planner\_core\_src\_roomle\_planner.default.md "mention").

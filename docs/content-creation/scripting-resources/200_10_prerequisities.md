# Prerequisities for Roomle Content Scripters

This document sums up recommended skills and prerequisities for scripting Roomle content (= writing component definitions). Note, that a lack in some of these skills does not mean you can't be a good scripter!

### Programming skills
* ability to design and implement algorithms
* a feeling for object oriented programming (components act as objects, including inter-component data interactions)
* knowledge of any specific API not required
* basic programming consturctions (variables, expressions, conditions, loops, arrays)
* code versioning, preferably using Git
* ability to write understandable and maintainable high quality code, that follows good practices

### 3D graphics basics
This theoretical knowledge is not essential for scripting Roomle content, but are highly recommended and advantageous to study eventually:
* RGB color space
* textures
* normal maps
* shader values: roughness, metallicity, alpha, etc.
* primitives, meshes, sketches, extrusion
    * vertices, triangles, normals, UVs
* transformations: movement, rotation

### Other non-mandatory, but advantegeous skills
* communicative knowledge of English (we have most documents and task descriptions in English, we also communicate in English or German)
    * comments and ids should be unviversally written in English
* it is an advantage to understand products' origin language (to understand manufacturer's drawings, catalogues etc.)
    * the most common language of produced configurator outside of English is German
* 3D vector algebra
    * position and normal vectors
    * transformations
    * coordinate systems
* CAD, construction, engineering
    * to understand and be able to measure in drawings, CAD models etc.
* 3D game engines
    * experience in 3D game development - Unity3D, Unreal etc.
    * because there you also bring 3D graphics to live :)

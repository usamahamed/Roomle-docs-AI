# About

The [Daten Competence Center e. V.](https://dcc-moebel.org) (DCC), is an independent, non-profit association that is involved in all areas of data communication for variant-rich and planning-intensive furniture. 

The DCC developed the uniform, standardized data format IDM ("Integriertes Datenmodell") in 2002. IDM enables a smooth exchange of information between industry, trade and software houses.

The further development of IDM is a focal point of the DCC work. The results are not only useful for the stationary distribution channel, but also used for online retail.
